# Question
In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer
The best time to use a `while` loop is when we do not have an explicit stopping condition for our loops, or if its unclear.

# Teacher Feedback

Not necessarily, think of more of when a **stopping condition** is unclear!
