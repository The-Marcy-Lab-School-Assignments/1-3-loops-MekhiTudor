# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
In order to achieve the same functionality as the loop above, without using a `break` statement. We have to change the current condition `i < 10` to `i < 7`. This is because the loop will end once i = 7 so it would be simpler to just change the conditions to match that.

# Teacher Feedback

The loop will actually end before it is 7 because you did not include the 7 in the stopping condition but regardless, you are correct in that we would change our stopping condition!
