# Question

Look at this function:

```js
const bailOut = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i > 3) return;
    console.log("Inside the loop", i);
  }
  console.log("Outside the loop");
};
```

Is that `console.log('Outside the loop');` ever going to run? Why or why not?

# Answer

It won't run because of the `return` statement. Whe the `return` keyword is used the function is exited so anything after it will not be read.

~~What happens when the keyword `return` is used? Because the `return` keyword is used, the function is exited so anything after this condition is met will not be read!~~
